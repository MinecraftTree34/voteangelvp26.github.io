        <p class="aboutme">**TL:DR at the bottom </p>

        <p class="aboutme"> If you are reading this, first of all thank you for your time. I'm Angel Giron, and I'm thrilled to tell you all about be. I enjoy playing a ton of intruments, for example, the e-guitar, the bass, the trumpet, the piano, the drumset, the saxophone, the violin, and a few others. I played in the Jazz Band, Wind Ensemble, Symphonic Swing Ensemble, and the Pit Orchestra at Tamanend! Not only do I enjoy Music, but I LOVE coding!
            
            <p class="aboutme">I've a few websites(not including this one) and I've even worked on a few video games of my own! I learned coding at 8 years old, and since master the art of Game Development.</p>
            
            <p class="aboutme">I also enjoy helping donate and distribute food at Barclay, so you might catch me there from time to time.</p>
            
            <p class="aboutme">And one of the coolest things that I've ever gotten a chance to do is Flight Camp! I stayed at a flight camp for a week, and we had fun flying airplanes and helicopters around Allentown, Doylestown, and a few other near by areas! </p>
            
            <p class="aboutme">Last but not least, I LOVE atronomy. Like space, not the goofy personality signs. I stayed a state park that was for dedicated stargazers and took a few of the following images through my telescope</p>

            <p class="aboutme">I believe thats all about me. There's probably much deeper things, but I aint tell you guys that!</p>
            <p class="aboutme">**TL:DR: My name is Angel Giron, I am a song writer playing multiple instruments and I love rock. I am also an aspiring coder, having made some of my own websites and a few video games in the works! I like to show off with the fact that I've gone to a Flight camp where I got to fly helicopters and planes. Finally, I love astronomy, and I went to a state park here in PA and took lots of photos through my telescope. </p>
